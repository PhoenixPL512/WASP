Okay, so here's the thing.
Code i wrote in "WASP" directory - it's not working. In the matter of fact, i don't know why.
So, basing on this code, i need to write functionality from scratch, step-by-step, and when i will get what i'm doing wrong - then, i hope, i will get original code working on Arduino.
