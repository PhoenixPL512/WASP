Well... This code IS NOT working, i'm not writing this anymore, leaving just for watching. If you want to see working code, go to WASPArduinoCode directory.
Why it's not working? Because Arduino IDE is having major problems with working with libraries, and i don't have time to debug this neither look for another IDE which offers compilation and uploading code using external programmer. This is madness.
